Names: Matthew Weiler, Jonathan Conrad, Joseph Gore

Project Details:

	URL (hardcoded in main.py):
		http://www.google.com/

	
	Requirements Fullfilled:
		This code fullfills part 1 in that it downloads the url http://www.google.com/ and displays the contents to the console.
			In order to do this, we needed to parse the url with creating the URLParser Class and using the python embeded
			urllib as well as socket lib to create the socket, and parse the url. 
		In addition to that, we created the Winsock class and defined the connect, send, and receive functions in that class.
			This was used to manage the different operations that the connection had to accomplish.
		

Notes:
	To run the code, you will want to run the weiler_conrad_gore_main.py file that we have presented in the WinsockPython directory.
